# Vite Plugin Dedale

vite-plugin-dedale is a plugin for [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that helps you navigate the complexities of creating static sites, much like the mythological figure Daedalus (or "DÃ©dale" in French).

vite-plugin-dedale offers a simple and flexible solution for managing the routes and templates of your static site. You can use JavaScript or TypeScript for your routes, and Nunjucks for your templates. vite-plugin-dedale also allows you to read Markdown files and retrieve their content and metadata.

When to use vite-plugin-dedale:

- If you need to generate a static site from variable data, such as a brochure website, a portfolio, a blog, or a documentation site

- If you want to use Nunjucks as your template engine and JavaScript or TypeScript for your routes

If vite-plugin-dedale doesn't meet your needs, you may want to consider other tools and plugins such as :

- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [Vite-plugin-eleventy](https://github.com/Snugug/vite-plugin-eleventy) (whose code inspired the development of vite-plugin-dedale)
- [Vituum](https://vituum.dev/)
- [Vite-plugin-ssr](https://vite-plugin-ssr.com/).

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install vite-plugin-dedale
```

## Configuration

vite-plugin-dedale accepts the following options in its configuration:

- `templateDir` (required): The path to the directory containing your Nunjucks templates.
- `contentDir` (optional): The path to the directory containing your content files (such as Markdown files). This option enables hot reloading of these files in development mode.
- `configureNunjucks` (optional): A function that allows you to customize the Nunjucks environment. This function takes in a Nunjucks environment as an argument and returns a modified version of that environment.
- `routes` (required): An array of route objects, each with the following properties:
  - `url` (string): The URL for this route.
  - `template` (string): The name of the Nunjucks template to use for this route.
  - `data` (object, optional): An object containing data to be passed to the Nunjucks template for this route.
